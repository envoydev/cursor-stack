# Solve Task - step mechanics

Read by `project-solve-task` at step 3 APPROVE, before the approve question is built; complete on
its own. Five rules live here, each applied at the step named: the mode-fit rule (step 3), the
APPROVAL stamp's write mechanics and lifetime (step 3 onward), the build bar (step 4), the
reviewer-fit rule (the step-4 stop) and the doc-drift surface list (step 6). The step-3 stop's `Result:` line carries
`mechanics: read` - the line that proves this file was loaded this cycle, not remembered from an
earlier one.

## Mode fit - the step-3 approve question

Two build modes, the recommendation decided per plan, the reason in the option's description:

- **session** - `project-implementer` runs the tasks in this chat. Fits when the tasks are few,
  serial, or one stack's.
- **agents** - each task card goes to its stack's `<stack>-implementer` seat, up to 3 at once. Fits
  when the plan holds independent tasks that can build in parallel (the measured multi-slice
  exception: built inline, such a plan cost a multiple of its dispatched build).

A fixed default is not a recommendation. Agents mode exists only where subagent dispatch is
available; where it is not, the question offers session only and says so.

## The APPROVAL stamp - writing it, and its lifetime

The stamp's path, its `AUTO` first line and the 'an earlier session's stamp is not consent' rule
are in `SKILL.md`; these are the mechanics around them.

- A write relative to the shell's working directory follows wherever that directory drifted, and
  the dispatch then bounces because the dispatch hook reads the stamp under the project root.
- If the stamp cannot be written at all, stop and put the choice to the user as one explicit
  question (retry the stamp, or run this stage inline) rather than retrying blind or dispatching
  around the gate.
- **Lifetime.** The AUTO stamp lives until step 6's close deletes it. Step 4's
  delete-when-fan-out-completes applies to per-plan APPROVED stamps, and a step-5 punch-list
  re-dispatch under AUTO rides the still-live waiver.

## The build bar - both modes

Both modes build to the bar `project-implementer` and every `<stack>-implementer` seat carry - the
quality loop's five stages met on the first pass, comments carrying the why, each judgment call
decided against the codebase's precedent - and the plan's `## Decisions` ledger grows as they
land: appended directly in session mode, folded in from each seat's `decisions:` report lines as
its report lands in agents mode.

## Reviewer fit - the step-4 stop's recommendation

Three options, one recommended, reason stated:

- **'project-verify-code in-session'** - a routine diff: no dispatch, stays in this context.
- **'the stack's `<stack>-verifier` seat'** - the diff is large, trips a risk trigger (auth,
  migration, concurrency, security, a big refactor), or was built in this session and deserves
  eyes that did not write it.
- **'skip'** - straight to step 6's done-gate; never the recommendation.

For a broad parallel sweep the user can still invoke `/review` themselves - it is not part of this
flow. The user can inspect the diff themselves at this stop before answering.

## Doc-drift surfaces - the step-6 close line

An architecture-critical surface, any one of which earns the close report's one-line pointer to
the architecture capture: a schema / EF migration, a new module or project, a moved boundary or
dependency direction, a changed cross-stack seam or eventing contract, a new external dependency.
