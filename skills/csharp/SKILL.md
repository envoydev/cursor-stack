description: Personal C# conventions (.NET 8 / C# 12 floor) - style/structure (file layout, naming, member/ctor ordering, methods, types, visibility, design-pattern (GoF) awareness, modern C# 12/13/14 syntax, forbidden patterns, XML doc) and runtime behavior (DateTime/IClock, async, dispose, exceptions + Result, structured logging, secrets/config, LINQ, System.Text.Json, decoupling + DI lifetimes). Load before creating or editing any `.cs` file - writing, reviewing, or refactoring C#; do not lean on recalled conventions. The always-load baseline; specialist areas (concurrency, performance, EF, web, messaging) route out through the `dotnet` companion router, not here.

# C# Conventions

Personal C# style, structure, and runtime conventions in one place: how code is shaped (naming, layout, syntax) and how it behaves (async, I/O, exceptions, logging, DI). Style is enforced by `.editorconfig` (Allman braces, 120-char line limit, file-scoped namespaces) and `EnforceCodeStyleInBuild=true`.

**Formatting, naming, and language-feature style is authoritative in `references/csharp-style.md`** (with the full canonical `.editorconfig`); the .NET Framework / C# 7.3 delta is `references/net-framework-48.md`. This file keeps the house rules those style docs do not cover - structure limits, member and constructor ordering, forbidden patterns, XML doc, and the runtime behavior below - and where it overlaps them, the style docs win. **Above all of these, a project's own `.editorconfig` and its `docs/PROJECT-CODE-STYLE.md` are higher priority: where a project diverges from these general conventions, follow the project.**

**Floor: .NET 8 / C# 12.** Every rule below assumes at least this target - `TimeProvider`, `UnsafeAccessorAttribute`, the static argument throw-helpers, and the C# 12 collection expressions / primary constructors are all in. Where a convention names a newer feature (C# 13 `System.Threading.Lock`, the `field` keyword), it flags the version inline; treat those as opt-in once the project's target moves up.

On a .NET Framework 4.8 (net48) codebase the C# 7.3 language ceiling, the polyfill packages, and the SynchronizationContext async caveat differ from this floor - those deltas are in `references/net-framework-48.md`.

Specialized concerns route through the `dotnet` router - one table mapping each area (concurrency, performance / memory layout, design patterns, serialization, DI registration, config binding, DDD, architecture, packaging) to its focused skill. Load the skill the router names; this file stays the style and runtime baseline only.

# Style and Structure

## File structure
- Max 300 lines per file - a file past that is accreting more than one responsibility. Split by extracting cohesive groups of methods into new classes.
- 120 columns per line in `.cs` files - the soft limit `references/csharp-style.md` sets; markdown, JSON, config files exempt.
- Partial classes only for generated code (EF migrations, designer files) or extending a generated class.
- One-type-per-file, file naming, and file-scoped namespaces follow `references/csharp-style.md` - it owns the detail.

## Naming

Casing, prefixes, and the `Async` suffix live in `references/csharp-style.md` - not repeated here. The house rule on top of them is naming *intent* - apply four tests to every name:
1. **Domain-aligned** - use vocabulary from the project domain. Avoid `Manager`, `Helper`, `Data`, `Info`, `Item`, or vague verbs like `Process` / `Handle` when a domain-specific term exists.
2. **Intent-revealing** - the name explains what the member does without reading the implementation.
3. **DDD-consistent** - value objects model concepts, not primitives. Don't suffix entity types with `Entity` or `Aggregate`. Do suffix repositories and services.
4. **Free of misleading names** - a method named `Save` must persist; a `Validate` method must not also mutate state.

## Class member ordering

Enforced by `.editorconfig`. Order: private constants/statics, private readonly, private fields, protected/public properties, constructors, public/protected/private methods. Public properties before the constructor.

## Constructor parameter ordering

Private readonly fields, constructor parameters, and constructor body assignments must follow the same order. Primary constructor parameter lists follow the same group order.

**Group order:**
1. `ILogger` / `ILogger<T>` - always first.
2. Other interfaces.
3. Classes (including sealed records, delegates such as `Func<>`, concrete service types).
4. Structs (value types).

Within each group, order by scope, broadest first. Required before optional - all defaulted params trail required ones.

## Blank lines

Enforced by `.editorconfig` / formatter. The non-mechanical rule: one blank line before control-transfer statements (`return`, `throw`, `break`, etc.) when preceded by another statement - so the exit visually separates from preceding logic.

## Methods
- Max 20 lines per method body - a longer body is doing more than one thing and resists review. Refactor if exceeded.
- Max 3 parameters. Use a parameter object (record or class) for more.
- Methods do one thing. If 'and' appears in a method name, split it.
- No `out` or `ref` parameters - they hide data flow at the call site and do not compose with async or LINQ; return a tuple or result object instead.
- Every `switch` case body wrapped in its own `{ }` block - even when one statement, even when no variable is declared. Brace any half-braced switch you edit. Example:

```csharp
switch (x)
{
    case A:
    {
        DoA();

        break;
    }
    case B:
    {
        var y = Compute();
        Use(y);

        return;
    }
    default:
    {
        return;
    }
}
```

Per-case braces give each case its own scope (no accidental variable leak); blank line before `break` / `return` when preceded by another statement; no blank line when the transfer is the only statement after `{` (the `default` above).

## Types and variables
- `var`, nullable reference types, records vs classes, and expression-bodied members: `references/csharp-style.md` is authoritative. The bullets below are the house additions it does not cover.
- Value objects: model as small immutable types - typically `readonly record struct` - validate in the constructor (trust everywhere after), and expose explicit conversions / factory methods only, never an `implicit operator` (it silently defeats the type safety it exists to provide). Add a `TypeConverter` when the value object must bind from configuration.
- Member signatures expose the narrowest useful shape: accept `IEnumerable<T>` / `IReadOnlyCollection<T>` / `IReadOnlyList<T>` (or `ReadOnlySpan<T>` on hot paths), and return a read-only collection type (`IReadOnlyList<T>`, `IReadOnlyDictionary<,>`); return a `List<T>` / array only when the caller is meant to mutate it.
- No magic numbers or magic strings - use named constants or enums.
- Enums: explicit underlying values for any enum persisted to a database or sent over the wire. Use `[Flags]` only when bitwise combination is intended.
- No public mutable fields - use properties.
- String comparison: always specify `StringComparison.Ordinal` for non-linguistic comparisons (identifiers, keys, file paths), `StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase` for case-insensitive. Never rely on culture-default comparison.

## Visibility and sealing
- Default to the lowest visibility that works: `private` for class members, `internal` for assembly-scoped types, `public` only for cross-assembly API.
- Mark new classes `sealed` unless inheritance is part of the design. Sealed classes enable JIT devirtualization and signal intent.
- Mark methods `virtual` or `abstract` only when overriding is genuinely required. Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Static classes only for pure utilities (no state, no I/O, no DI dependencies). For anything else, use a regular class with DI.
- Static fields only for true constants or thread-safe caches. Mutable static state is forbidden.

## Design patterns (GoF awareness)
Reach for the framework-native construct before hand-rolling a pattern - most GoF patterns are already in the platform. Which construct replaces which pattern, the selection table, and the anti-pattern checks are `csharp-design-patterns`'s; load it to choose, implement, compare, or refactor toward any pattern.

## Modern C# syntax preferences

The modern-feature style - primary constructors, collection expressions, raw strings, `required` members, the `field` keyword, pattern matching, switch expressions - is authoritative in `references/csharp-style.md` (language feature usage). Two house preferences that document does not name: prefer `params ReadOnlySpan<T>` (C# 13) for new internal zero-alloc APIs over `params T[]`, and `System.Threading.Lock` (C# 13) for new lock objects (do not retrofit existing `lock(object)` sites).

Performance concerns (sealing, readonly structs, `Span<T>` / `Memory<T>` / `ArrayPool<T>`, collection choice) belong with the `dotnet-performance` skill.

## Forbidden patterns
- No `#region` blocks - a file that needs regions to navigate is too big; split it instead.
- No `using static` for non-utility classes.
- No commented-out code - delete it.
- No `TODO` without an associated ticket reference.
- No reflection in business or hot-path code; use source generators or compile-time alternatives. No object-mapping libraries (AutoMapper / Mapster / ExpressMapper) - write explicit mapping methods (compile-time checked, debuggable, refactor-safe). Reflection is acceptable only in serialization, the DI container, ORM / EF, test infrastructure, or one-time bootstrap - never for DTO / domain mapping. When you must reach a private member (serializer, test helper), use `UnsafeAccessorAttribute` (.NET 8), not `System.Reflection`.

When a convention here drives a package change - adding, removing, or swapping one (e.g. dropping a banned mapper, replacing Newtonsoft with System.Text.Json) - the install itself follows `dotnet-project-setup`: use the `dotnet` CLI, never hand-edit `Directory.Packages.props`.
- No `dynamic` - use `object` + pattern matching or a typed interface.
- No top-level statements outside `Program.cs`.

## Documentation
- Every public API surface has XML doc comments covering parameters, return values, thrown exceptions, and remarks for non-obvious behavior.
- Write them in the expanded multi-line form: open and close each tag on its own line with the text on separate `///` lines, in full descriptive sentences - what the member does plus the context a caller needs - never a terse fragment collapsed onto a single `/// <summary>...</summary>` line. Give `<returns>` and every `<param>` the same expanded treatment, not only `<summary>`.

```csharp
// Good - expanded block, full descriptive sentences, <returns> documented:
/// <summary>
/// Retrieves the feature flags that govern checkout from the current database session.
/// These flags decide which payment providers are enabled for the request.
/// </summary>
/// <returns>
/// A read-only list of FeatureFlag entries keyed by name for the checkout module.
/// </returns>

// Avoid - collapsed onto one line, terse, no <returns>:
/// <summary>Loads the checkout feature flags.</summary>
```

# Runtime and Behavior

Behavior, I/O, and composition rules.

## DateTime and timezones
- Store and pass `DateTimeOffset`, not `DateTime`, for any value crossing process or DB boundaries.
- All persisted timestamps in UTC. Convert to local only at the presentation boundary.
- Never call `DateTime.Now` or `DateTime.UtcNow` directly in business logic. Inject an `IClock` / `ISystemClock` abstraction (or `TimeProvider` on .NET 8+).
- Never call `DateTime.Now` for measurements - use `Stopwatch`.

## Async
The async baseline - async all the way with no `.Result` / `.Wait()` / `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()`, no `async void` outside event handlers, `ValueTask` only where benchmarks justify it and never awaited twice, `await foreach` for async streams - is authoritative in `references/csharp-style.md`. House additions:
- Always pass and forward `CancellationToken` for I/O-bound or long-running operations.
- Use `ConfigureAwait(false)` in library code; ignore it in ASP.NET Core application code (no sync context).
- Return `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` for streaming results (paged DB reads, long-running enumerations); annotate the `CancellationToken` parameter with `[EnumeratorCancellation]`.

## Dispose pattern
- Use `using` declarations (`using var x = ...;`) over `using` blocks where scope allows.
- Implement `IAsyncDisposable` for types holding async resources. Implement both `IDisposable` and `IAsyncDisposable` when both sync and async disposal paths are realistic.
- Never call `Dispose()` on injected dependencies - the DI container owns their lifetime.
- Use the full Dispose pattern (`protected virtual Dispose(bool disposing)`) only for unmanaged resources or when inheritance is in play. Otherwise a simple `Dispose()` is enough.

## Exception handling and Result pattern
- Distinguish expected outcomes from exceptional failures. Validation, not-found, and business-rule failures are expected - return a result type rather than throwing. Prefer a domain-specific result (a sealed record with `Success` / `Failed` factory methods and an error-code enum, e.g. `CreateOrderResult`) over a generic `Result<T>` / `OneOf<,>` when the operation's failure modes are known.
- Exceptions for unexpected failures only (I/O errors, programming errors, contract violations).
- Catch specific exceptions; never bare `catch (Exception)` in business logic unless logging and re-throwing.
- Do not use exceptions for control flow.
- Re-throw with `throw;` not `throw ex;` (preserves stack trace).
- Validate arguments at the top of public methods. Prefer the static throw-helpers over hand-written guards: `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(x)`, `ArgumentException.ThrowIfNullOrWhiteSpace(s)`, `ArgumentOutOfRangeException.ThrowIfNegative` / `ThrowIfGreaterThan(...)` (.NET 8).
- Mapping a Result to an HTTP response and the `ProblemDetails` contract are the web surface - route via `dotnet` to `dotnet-error-handling`; don't shape HTTP errors in business code.

## Logging
- Structured logging via `ILogger<T>`. Use templates with named placeholders: `_logger.LogInformation('Order {OrderId} placed for {UserId}', orderId, userId)`. Never use string interpolation in log calls.
- Log levels: `Trace` (diagnostic noise), `Debug` (dev), `Information` (business events), `Warning` (recoverable issue), `Error` (operation failed), `Critical` (system unusable).
- Log exceptions with the exception object as the first arg: `_logger.LogError(ex, 'Failed to {Action}', actionName)`. Never `.ToString()` an exception into the message.
- Never log: passwords, tokens, secrets, full payment data, PII beyond what is operationally needed. For healthcare and e-commerce projects, treat full identifiers as PII.
- One log statement per logical event. Avoid log spam in tight loops.

## Secrets and configuration sources
- Where secrets live (dev vs prod placement) is owned by `dotnet-security`; reach for it rather than restating the rule here.
- Configuration layering: `appsettings.json` (defaults) -> `appsettings.{Environment}.json` -> environment variables -> command-line args. Later layers override earlier.
- Hashing / encryption primitives route via `dotnet` to `dotnet-cryptography`; the secret-leak / OWASP hardening boundary is `dotnet-security`.

Typed options binding (`IOptions<T>` / `IOptionsSnapshot<T>` / `IOptionsMonitor<T>`) and startup validation (`ValidateOnStart`, `IValidateOptions<T>`, data-annotation validation) live in `dotnet-web-backend` (its typed-options section) - consult it for those, do not restate here.

## LINQ
Method-vs-query syntax choice, chain wrapping, multiple-enumeration, and terminal-operator intent are authoritative in `references/csharp-style.md`. House additions:
- No more than 4-5 chained operators without an intermediate variable with a descriptive name.
- Materialize queries (`ToList`, `ToArray`) before returning from a method that owns the DbContext or connection lifetime.

## JSON serialization
- `System.Text.Json` is the default. Newtonsoft.Json only for legacy compatibility or features missing from STJ (e.g. polymorphic serialization in older runtimes).
- Configure `JsonSerializerOptions` once and reuse - never construct per call.
- Naming policy: `JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase` for external APIs unless a contract requires otherwise.
- Reach for source-generated `JsonSerializerContext` on hot paths and under AOT - the source-gen mechanics and the wire-format choice (Protobuf / MessagePack vs JSON) are `dotnet-performance`.
- Never deserialize untrusted JSON without size and depth limits.

## Decoupling and DI lifetimes
- Never call `new` on service-layer or infrastructure types inside a class body - use factories or DI.
- No circular dependencies between namespaces.
- Never inject a shorter-lifetime service into a longer-lifetime one (captive dependency). Use `IServiceScopeFactory` or a `Func<T>` factory for cross-lifetime access.
- Composition mechanics - grouping a feature's registrations behind an `Add*` extension, keyed services, factory registration, and `TryAdd` - are `references/dependency-injection.md`; this section owns only the lifetime rules.
