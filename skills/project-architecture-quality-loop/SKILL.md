# Architecture Quality Loop - Analyze, Assess, Improve (Deliberate)

You drive a deliberate loop that improves a project's architecture: analyze it, produce a reasoned assessment, work the fixable weaknesses by tier, reconcile the docs, and loop until the fixable ones are resolved or the loop plateaus. This is the heavy, on-purpose counterpart to the code-focused `project-quality-loop` - it runs only when a user invokes it (`/project-architecture-quality-loop`), never automatically, because architecture analysis is expensive and architecture changes are consequential.

Best run in Cursor, where you can dispatch the analysis and build seats and edit files across rounds. On a large codebase, scope it - point it at one bounded context or module subtree per run. The architecture judgment runs in-session (per the capture) and Cursor cannot pin a model per skill, so a long run wants the session itself on a model you would trust with design work.

## Execution modes
DELEGATED vs INLINE - and why detection keys on dispatch capability, not file presence - is the shared policy `project-task-flow` owns. Pick the mode once, before ANALYZE, hold it for the run, and apply it to the loop:

- **DELEGATED** (dispatch available) - the main session dispatches every seat - code-analyzer for the capture's gathering, then the domain designer / implementers / verifier for a substantial fix, or an implementer for a small one - never doing their work itself (the architecture reasoning itself runs in the main session, per the capture). This skill and `project-task-flow` are manual (`disable-model-invocation`), so a substantial fix runs the stack vertical by dispatching that stack's seats directly - the loop discipline is `project-task-flow`'s `references/domain-trio-protocol.md`.
- **INLINE** (no dispatch: Cursor, a non-stack project, or a scope too small to fan out) - do the same steps in-session: map and assess the architecture yourself against the house architecture skills, then apply the fixable cons directly, smallest blast radius first.

## The loop

### 1. ANALYZE + ASSESS
Run the `project-architecture-analyzer` capture over the target: dispatch code-analyzer per module, reason over the digests in-session, and write `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` (the structure map) and `docs/architecture/ASSESSMENT.md` (10 reasoned strengths + 10 reasoned weaknesses, each weakness carrying a remediation and a tier: small / substantial / structural) - both `docs/architecture/` paths resolve under the project's configured docs root (default `docs/`, per its AGENTS.md). Read `docs/architecture/ASSESSMENT.md`: the weaknesses are this loop's work list, the tier on each is its routing key, and any weakness the summary marks a deliberate tradeoff is left alone - do not 'fix' a conscious choice.

### 2. TRIAGE + FIX by tier
Take the open weaknesses in leverage order (the assessment's top-few first). Route each by its tier - and confirm the green baseline (build + tests) before you start, so a regression is visible. Hold every fix against the assessment's Strengths list: a remediation whose entry names a strength tension is applied the way the entry preserves the strength, and a fix that turns out mid-round to erode a listed strength stops - resolving a weakness by breaking a strength is a net loss, and a genuine strength-vs-weakness tradeoff is a structural-tier user decision, never an auto-fix:

- **small** (a localized edit) - dispatch the matching domain implementer with the remediation as a scoped brief (the file/symbol, the smallest correct change, the check that proves it). Re-run build + tests.
- **substantial** (a designer-led multi-task change) - dispatch the domain solution-designer to turn the remediation into a decomposition, **get the user's approval on that plan before building** (an architecture refactor is consequential - never fan out against an unapproved structural plan), then fan the tasks out to the domain implementers and gate the assembled result with the domain verifier, looping its punch-list back. This is the domain-trio vertical (`project-task-flow`'s `references/domain-trio-protocol.md`), dispatched directly.
- **structural** (a risky, cross-cutting rework) - do NOT auto-apply. Present the weakness, its reasoning, and the remediation to the user and get an explicit decision; only then, if approved, route it as a substantial change. A structural rework the user has not approved is flagged in the final report, not attempted.

Keep the build and tests green across the round: after each fix batch, re-run them, and a red routes to the matching resolver (dotnet-build-error-resolver / dotnet-test-failure-resolver / ng-build-error-resolver / angular-test-resolver) before the next weakness.

### 3. UPDATE DOCS
Re-run the project-architecture-analyzer capture, so `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/architecture/ASSESSMENT.md` reconcile with what shipped - the resolved weaknesses drop off, the new boundaries and patterns land in the map, and any weakness the fix exposed is added. The assessment is regenerated, not hand-edited: the capture owns those docs.

### 4. LOOP or STOP
Re-read the reconciled `docs/architecture/ASSESSMENT.md` and decide, off the weakness set, not by eye:

- **SATISFIED** - no fixable (small/substantial) weakness remains; only accepted tradeoffs and user-declined structural items are left.
- **PLATEAU** - the fixable-weakness set equals the previous round's and none is now resolvable - stop rather than re-run identically.
- **CAPPED** - you reached the improve-round cap (see Bounded and honest).
- **BLOCKED** - only structural weaknesses remain and the user has not approved a rework - report and stop.

Then emit the final report:
- **Outcome** - SATISFIED / PLATEAU / CAPPED / BLOCKED, and on which round.
- **Resolved** - each weakness fixed, its tier, and the change that closed it.
- **Deferred** - structural items the user declined or has not decided, plus accepted tradeoffs left alone.
- **Docs** - the reconciled `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` + `docs/architecture/ASSESSMENT.md` state.
- **Baseline** - build + tests green at stop (or the red that blocked it).

## Example

DELEGATED, one run over the Orders module:
1. **ANALYZE + ASSESS** - run the project-architecture-analyzer capture; ARCHITECTURE.md + ASSESSMENT.md land with tiered weaknesses. The top two: a **small** con (a repository leaks an EF type across the boundary) and a **substantial** con (queries and handlers share one grab-bag namespace).
2. **FIX by tier** - confirm the green baseline. Small: dispatch aspnet-implementer with a scoped brief, re-run build + tests. Substantial: dispatch aspnet-solution-designer for a decomposition, get approval, fan out implementers, gate with aspnet-verifier. A **structural** con (invert the persistence dependency) is flagged for a user decision, not auto-applied.
3. **UPDATE DOCS** - re-run the capture; the two fixed weaknesses drop off the reconciled docs.
4. **LOOP or STOP** - re-read ASSESSMENT.md: only the user-declined structural item and accepted tradeoffs remain -> **SATISFIED**. Emit the final report.

## Bounded and honest
- **Hard cap: 3 improve rounds.** Architecture work is expensive and each round re-runs the capture; do not loop indefinitely chasing the last debatable con.
- Never weaken a test or delete an assertion to make a con look resolved - that is a new weakness, not a fix.
- Make the smallest change that resolves each weakness; a rewrite that introduces new coupling makes the loop diverge.
- The assessment's tier is the routing authority - do not silently upgrade a small con into a rewrite, or downgrade a structural one to sneak it past the approval gate.

## Rules
- Manual only (`disable-model-invocation`): this skill runs when the user invokes `/project-architecture-quality-loop`, never on its own.
- The main session is the only orchestrator. The build seats it dispatches - the domain designer / implementers / verifier / resolvers - carry no Agent tool, so the fan-out stays flat; a con needing analysis and a fix is separate dispatches from here, not one nested one. The capture's code-analyzer fan-out is also dispatched from here, flat - there is no dispatched architecture seat and no nesting.
- Substantial and structural changes are gated on user approval before building; small localized fixes proceed. Architecture changes are consequential - confirm before reshaping the structure.
- Keep this skill orchestration only. The architecture judgement lives in the project-architecture-analyzer capture and the house architecture skills it loads; the build knowledge lives in the domain seats. For a pure code-quality polish reach for `project-quality-loop`; for a single feature build reach for `project-task-flow`.
