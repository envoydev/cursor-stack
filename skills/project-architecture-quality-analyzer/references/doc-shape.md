## Why this doc lives outside the docs-domain engine

`<docs-path>/quality/` carries no `watch.json`, so `domains()` in `.cursor/hooks/docs.js` never picks it up - it
is not a docs domain at all. That is deliberate: weaknesses and strengths are a function of the map plus the
code, recomputable on demand for whatever branch you are on. A domain exists to make a doc survive a branch
switch (git versioning, or a local overlay folded back at merge) - and there is nothing here worth making
survive, because the next run reproduces it from source. Versioning a recomputed doc would be storing a cache
and calling it a record. No `<!-- id: -->` / `<!-- covers: -->` comment lines, no section-level stamp, no
`docs.js set`, no `docs.js lint` pass, no branch-overlay question at session end - none of that machinery applies
here, and this skill never invokes it. On a project that commits its docs, plain git tracks the file exactly like
any other tracked file, with no per-branch overlay; on a project whose docs root is local-only, this file is
local too, same as the rest of the root.

## <docs-path>/decisions/ - the domain a person writes, this skill only reads

Unlike `quality/`, `<docs-path>/decisions/` IS a docs domain: it carries its own `watch.json`, so
`domains()` in `.cursor/hooks/docs.js` picks it up and the engine sections, lints and watches it like
any other - with one deliberate difference, declared in that same `watch.json`.

**`DECISIONS.md` is the index. Existing ADR files stay exactly where they are, as siblings.** Nothing is
rewritten or renamed - each ADR gains a `<!-- id: -->` and a `<!-- covers: -->` comment under its
heading, the same section format every domain uses, so the engine can find and quote it. `DECISIONS.md`
is the one file a reader starts from, one line per ADR.

**The domain declares every one of its own documents `notOwned`, by GLOB, never by listing filenames.**
ADR files are unbounded - a name-by-name list would go stale the moment someone adds a record - so
`decisions/watch.json` covers the whole domain with one glob:

    {
      "notOwned": ["**.md"],
      "watch": [
        { "kind": "refund flow", "globs": ["src/Payments/RefundService.cs"], "sections": ["0001-refunds-synchronous#refunds-stay-synchronous"] }
      ]
    }

`**.md` is the spelling proven against the real engine's `matches()` / `globRe` (docs.js), not assumed:
`globRe` treats a bare `*` as stopping at one path segment, so the plausible-looking `**/*.md` actually
MISSES every file that sits directly in `decisions/` - `DECISIONS.md` and every ADR - and protects only
`references/` and `history/`, leaving the very files this exists to protect writable. `*.md` alone has
the opposite gap: it protects the root siblings but not `references/` or `history/`. `**.md` is the one
spelling that matches both a bare filename and any path under a subfolder, so it covers the whole
domain - root, `references/` and `history/` alike.

With every `.md` in the domain declared `notOwned`, `domainFiles('decisions')` is empty - proven on a
temp fixture, not assumed: `docs.js files`, `docs.js lint`, `docs.js status`, `docs.js where`,
`docs.js seed-ids` and `docs.js promote` all ran clean against a decisions domain with zero domainFiles,
and the session-start block named the domain
without listing a file for it. An empty domain is the intended shape once every document in it is
protected, not a bug case to guard against.

**Why a person, and only a person, writes here.** A decision record says why something is the way it is
on purpose - not what the code currently does, which is recomputable, but what someone chose and why,
which is not. The findings gate's fourth question below is 'has the project already decided this', and
an analyzer that could answer its own gate by writing to the log it reads would be marking its own
homework: the record would drift toward whatever the last automated run preferred, and every re-run
would reopen an argument that was supposed to be settled. `notOwned` makes the rule unbreakable rather
than merely stated: every write to this domain, from any actor and any spelling, is refused by the
engine itself (`docs.js set` answers 'is maintained by another skill - this engine does not write it').

**Falsifiable by code, not only protected from it.** `decisions/watch.json` still carries ordinary
`watch` entries - `covers:` globs on each ADR's own section, naming the code that decision constrains,
exactly like any other domain's sections. When a change hits one of those globs, the session hook warns
instead of asking: it names the decision and quotes its first sentence, and offers no command - this
engine cannot rewrite a person's record, so it never pretends it can.

**What a person does when the warning fires.** The warning is not a gate on the turn - the whole
obligation it carries is that the agent reports the contradiction plainly rather than routing around it.
From there the call is a person's, not the engine's: either the decision no longer holds (write a new
ADR and mark the old one superseded, per `docs-as-code`'s ADR guidance), or the code drifted from a
decision still in force (fix or revert the change). Both outcomes are legitimate; the engine picks
neither, because picking would be exactly the homework-marking the single-writer rule above exists to
prevent. The one wrong answer is silence - an agent that saw the warning and said nothing has hidden a
contradiction the whole mechanism exists to surface.

## The findings gate - pass all four questions or it is not a finding

Before ANY candidate is recorded as a weakness, answer all four explicitly; an unanswerable question is a fail, and a failed candidate is routed (Worth knowing, or folded into an existing entry) or dropped - never tiered:

1. **What breaks?** The concrete wrong outcome - wrong or lost data, a crash or 5xx, a security hole, a change that cannot be made safely, or time repeatedly lost by the next developer. 'It differs from how another codebase or a reference doc would do it' is not an answer.
2. **Who notices, and when?** A user, an operator, or the next person to touch this code - named, with the trigger condition.
3. **Is it actually new?** Unchanged code whose behaviour the last run's `<docs-path>/quality/ASSESSMENT.md` already records - a known limit, an accepted tradeoff, an existing entry - is a re-measurement, not a discovery: fold the sharper number into the existing entry. Never open a new entry for it, and never re-tier the old one upward merely because it now has a number.
4. **Has the project already decided this?** Read the decision log FIRST (`<docs-path>/decisions/` per the shape above, where that domain has been seeded - or wherever the project keeps ADRs otherwise). A recorded decision is not a defect, and re-raising it each round is exactly the failure this gate exists to stop.

**The external-preference rule.** A convention skill, reference doc, or industry pattern preferring a different approach is not evidence of a weakness. Where this project has a mechanism that works, it wins unless you can show it FAILING - a real miss, a real regression it let through. A candidate whose only support is 'a reference prefers X' lands under Worth knowing at most, never tiered.

## The count rule - an output, never a target, in both directions

- **Never pad upward.** No observation is promoted to a weakness, and no minor to a major, to make the doc look thorough. Zero gate-passing weaknesses is a valid, complete result on a healthy codebase - state it plainly.
- **Never truncate downward.** EVERY candidate that passed the gate is recorded - twenty-five real weaknesses means the doc carries twenty-five; dropping one because a list is getting long is silent data loss the next run cannot detect. Strengths the same: every genuine one, not a round number.
- **Length is handled by ranking and spilling, never by deletion.** Order by blast radius so the top is actionable at a glance; spill entry detail to `<docs-path>/architecture/references/` topic files (this doc has no `references/` of its own - it borrows the map's, since the detail is about the code, not about this file). The entry itself stays. The threshold that triggers the spill is in *Format discipline* below - ~300 lines, `wc -l`-checked after the write; without a number this rule never fires.

## The three buckets - every surviving item lands in exactly one

| Bucket | Meaning | The quality loop may act on it? |
|---|---|---|
| **Must fix** | A real defect that passed the gate - carries Tier, Remediation, Strength check | Yes |
| **Worth knowing** | True and verified, but no action warranted now: a documented ceiling, a declared scope limit, a measured property of an accepted tradeoff. Not a weakness. | Never - a loop must not 'fix' these |
| **Deliberate tradeoff** | A decision the project made on purpose, with the reason | Never - and never re-raise it |

No bucket has a size limit. **Worth knowing retirement rule** - what stops the list growing forever: every entry states the condition that would promote it to Must fix - an entry whose promotion condition you cannot state is dropped, not listed. Each re-run checks every entry against its own condition: promote it, leave it, or DELETE it when the condition can no longer occur. That is the one sanctioned way an entry leaves the list - by its own recorded condition, never by trimming.

## The shape

- **Strengths** - every genuine strength the analysis found, titled, each with the reasoning (what it buys - testability, isolation, evolvability, clear ownership) tied to located code (the module / boundary / pattern it comes from). However many that is - a small codebase supports few; say so rather than invent.
- **Must fix** - every weakness that passed the gate, titled, ranked by blast radius, each with the reasoning (what it costs - coupling, fragility, blast radius, a captive dependency, a perf or consistency hazard) tied to located code, then two required fields. W-IDs are rank labels, not stable identities: a re-rank RENUMBERS so W1 is always the current top item; a cross-run reference cites the title, not the number, and a user reorder ask that is ambiguous about renumbering gets asked. Test-suite weaknesses are OUT OF SCOPE - coverage numbers, missing or weak tests, absent test infrastructure belong to the `project-test-coverage-analyzer` capture and its COVERAGE.md, never here (the two docs would drift over the same fact). The architecture-side line stays in: a *structural* testability blocker (a missing seam, static coupling, a dependency that cannot be substituted) is an architecture weakness; the tests it blocks are the coverage capture's.
  - **Remediation** - concretely how to resolve it: the boundary to introduce, the dependency to invert, the pattern to adopt, the seam to guard with a fitness test. Every remediation is **strength-checked** against the Strengths list before it lands: if applying it would erode a listed strength, the entry names that tension and shapes the fix to preserve the strength - and where the two genuinely trade off, the entry says so explicitly, which forces the weakness to the structural tier (a user decision, never an auto-fix).
  - **Tier** - **small** (a localized edit an implementer can land), **substantial** (a designer-led multi-task change - decompose, build, verify), or **structural** (a risky cross-cutting rework - flag it, do not let a loop auto-apply it).

  One entry in that shape:

  > **W3 - Invoicing queries Orders' persistence entities across the module boundary.** `InvoiceBuilder.BuildAsync` reaches into Orders' data context directly (located: `Invoicing/InvoiceBuilder` -> `Orders.Order`), so an Orders schema change ripples into Invoicing untested - the boundary exists in folders, not in the dependency graph.
  > **Remediation** - feed Invoicing from an Orders-owned read projection (or an integration event), and guard the seam with an architecture test asserting Invoicing never references Orders' data context.
  > **Strength check** - preserves S2 (module isolation): the projection keeps Orders' persistence private instead of widening the shared surface a direct-reference fix would.
  > **Tier** - substantial.
- **Worth knowing** - one line per entry plus its promotion condition; detail spills to a `references/` topic file when it needs more. A long list stays cheap to read - that is what the lighter shape is for.
- **Deliberate tradeoffs** - the decision and the reason it was made, so no later run re-litigates it. Sourced from the decision log (gate question 4) - never written here from this skill's own judgment.
- **Proposed decisions** - a repeatedly-declined Must-fix entry, or a tradeoff this run judged worth recording, shaped ready to accept: the claim, the reason, what it costs. This skill NEVER writes to the decision log; a person accepts a proposal by writing it themselves, at which point the next run's gate question 4 picks it up and the entry moves out of Must fix.
- **Summary** - the per-bucket and Must-fix tier tally, and the top few highest-leverage fixes.

## Format discipline - the budget

This doc is read at intake by every `project-architecture-quality-loop` round, so its weight is paid again each
time - and a rule with no threshold never fires.

- **Target: ~300 lines.** Double the map's, because an entry carries reasoning the map does not - but a number, and a checked one: `wc -l` it after the write, and over target run the spill pass. Spilling is not deleting: the entry's title, tier, one-line cost and its Remediation and Strength-check fields stay inline; the supporting detail - the located-code walkthrough, the measurement, the alternatives weighed - moves to `<docs-path>/architecture/references/<topic>.md` and the entry links it. Ranking still comes first, so the top of the doc is actionable before anything is spilled.
- **No per-round history in this doc, ever.** Not '3 rounds inline, then archive' like a versioned doc gets - none at all. A running log of what changed round to round is exactly the kind of thing that belongs to a record, not a cache; recomputing this file fresh every run means there is no 'round' to log inside it. A project that wants that history keeps it in `project-architecture-quality-loop`'s own report trail, never here.

## Write mechanics

**No write gate, no diff check, no stamp-triggered skip.** Every other capture in this stack asks before
overwriting an existing doc, because that doc accretes content a person might still want. This one does not ask:
it is recomputed from the map, the code and the decision log every time it runs, so there is nothing an overwrite
could destroy that a re-run would not reproduce anyway. REPLACE the file wholesale - Write over whatever was
there (READ it first if it exists, so the Write is legal - a delete-then-write costs a blocked or extra call for
nothing).

Open the doc with a freshness line for the human reader - `As of: <branch>@<short-sha>, <YYYY-MM-DD>` (`+dirty`
appended when the working tree holds uncommitted changes). This is informational only, never a gate: nothing
reads it to decide whether to skip the run, unlike the `Captured:` stamp on a real domain doc.

Create `<docs-path>/quality/` only when absent. Write ONLY `<docs-path>/quality/ASSESSMENT.md` - never source,
never the map, never the decision log. After the write, `wc -l` it against the ~300-line target above and run
the spill pass now if it is over.
