# WPF conventions

WPF is a retained-mode XAML UI on the data-binding engine. The whole discipline below exists to keep
view concerns (visuals, the visual tree, the dispatcher) on one side of a line and application state
on the other, so the state side stays a plain testable C# object. Floor is .NET 8 / C# 12.

**XAML formatting and naming style - attribute ordering (XAML Styler), `x:Name` vs `Name`, property-element syntax, namespace prefixes, value-converter naming, and binding style - live in `references/xaml-style.md`.** This SKILL.md owns the WPF architecture (strict MVVM, dependency/attached properties, threading); styles, resource dictionaries, and theming are `references/styling-theming.md`; the C# naming baseline is the `csharp` skill. Above these general conventions, a project's own `Settings.XamlStyler` / `.editorconfig` and its `docs/PROJECT-CODE-STYLE.md` win where they diverge.

On .NET Framework 4.8 these conventions hold, but the CommunityToolkit.Mvvm source generators, Generic
Host composition, and app-level exception wiring carry net48-specific constraints - see
`references/net-framework-48.md`.

## MVVM is the architecture, not a suggestion

Three layers, with a deliberately one-directional dependency:

- **View** - the `.xaml` plus a code-behind file that holds only view-only mechanics (nothing the
  ViewModel could own).
- **ViewModel** - observable state plus `ICommand`s. A plain CLR object.
- **Model** - the domain. Knows nothing about either layer above it.

The dependency points one way: the View references its ViewModel, the ViewModel never references the
View. The concrete test is types - if a ViewModel mentions `Window`, `UserControl`, `Dispatcher`,
`Visibility`, or any visual-tree element, the line has been crossed. State leaves the ViewModel as
bindable properties and commands; the binding engine does the rest.

Set the binding context by convention (a ViewModel-locator or DI-resolved `DataContext`), not with
`new SomeViewModel()` in code-behind, so the ViewModel's dependencies stay injectable.

## App composition and startup

Compose the app through the .NET generic host, not hand-rolled service location or `new` in code-behind.

- Build a `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting` host in `App.xaml.cs`, register windows, ViewModels, and services on it, resolve the main window from the container in `OnStartup`, and drop `StartupUri` - the window's dependencies then inject through its constructor.
- Turn on `ValidateScopes` and `ValidateOnBuild` so captive-dependency and disposed-scope mistakes fail at startup instead of at runtime.
- Never call `BuildServiceProvider` inside registration to pull a service early - it stands up a second container and leaks a duplicate set of singletons.

## Pairing with a Windows Service

A WPF desktop is often the front for a Windows Service companion - a tray or dashboard UI over a background daemon. Build the service half as a worker, not WPF code: its host composition, the SCM lifetime, `AppContext.BaseDirectory` path resolution, and least-privilege service account are `dotnet-hosted-services`' domain - load that skill for the service process. The two share only a contract - a named pipe, a local socket, a file or database, an IPC channel - never a UI thread or a `Dispatcher`; a service-pushed update crosses into the app as data and marshals onto the UI thread like any other off-thread work.

## Naming and pairing

- View: `OrderListView.xaml` and `OrderListView.xaml.cs`.
- ViewModel: `OrderListViewModel.cs`.
- The pair lives in the same feature folder. Folder-per-feature beats type-per-folder (`Views/`,
  `ViewModels/`) once a screen has more than a couple of files.

## Observable state with the toolkit, not by hand

Use `CommunityToolkit.Mvvm`. Derive the ViewModel from `ObservableObject`, declare backing fields
with `[ObservableProperty]`, and let the source generator emit the property, the `PropertyChanged`
raise, and partial change hooks. Hand-writing `INotifyPropertyChanged` with `SetField` /
`CallerMemberName` boilerplate is wasted code and a place for bugs.

- `[NotifyPropertyChangedFor(nameof(FullName))]` keeps a derived property in sync without a manual
  raise.
- `[NotifyCanExecuteChangedFor(nameof(SaveCommand))]` re-queries a command's `CanExecute` when its
  input changes - cleaner than calling `NotifyCanExecuteChanged()` from a setter.

```csharp
public sealed partial class OrderListViewModel : ObservableObject
{
    [ObservableProperty]
    [NotifyCanExecuteChangedFor(nameof(SaveCommand))]
    private string? customerName;                 // generates CustomerName + change raise

    [RelayCommand(CanExecute = nameof(CanSave))]
    private void Save()
    {
        // persist through an injected service
    }

    private bool CanSave() => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(CustomerName);
}
```

## Commands, not Click handlers

- Buttons, menu items, and key gestures bind `Command` (an `ICommand`); they do not wire `Click` in
  code-behind. Declare commands with `[RelayCommand]` - the generator produces the `IRelayCommand`
  property and threads `CanExecute` from a named predicate.
- Pass command parameters through `CommandParameter` and a typed `[RelayCommand]` method argument,
  not by reaching into the View.
- Deeper command orchestration - undo/redo stacks, command queues, snapshot/restore - is plain C#
  (Command, Memento, Observer) and routes to `csharp-design-patterns`, not into the ViewModel.

## Async commands carry a token and own their faults

- An async command is a `Task`-returning method under `[RelayCommand]` (which produces an
  `AsyncRelayCommand`), or `AsyncRelayCommand` directly. Never wrap async work behind a synchronous
  `ICommand` and block on `.Result` / `.Wait()` - that deadlocks against the UI `SynchronizationContext`.
- Bind the generated `IsRunning` to button enable-state and a busy indicator. Do not maintain a
  parallel hand-rolled `bool` busy flag.
- Take a `CancellationToken` as the last command parameter (the toolkit supplies one) so long work
  can be cancelled; cancel it on view teardown.

```csharp
[RelayCommand(IncludeCancelCommand = true)]   // also generates LoadOrdersCancelCommand
private async Task LoadOrdersAsync(CancellationToken token)
{
    try
    {
        Orders = await orderService.GetOrdersAsync(token);
    }
    catch (OperationCanceledException)
    {
        // cancelled - nothing to surface
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        await dialogService.ShowErrorAsync(ex.Message);
    }
}
```
- A faulting `Task` inside a command is silent by default. Catch inside the command and surface the
  failure through an injected `IDialogService` or an error property - never let the `Task` fault
  unobserved. The throw-vs-return baseline and the async rules (`ConfigureAwait`, no blocking) are
  the `csharp` skill's; they apply unchanged here.
- `AsyncRelayCommand` has two fault models - pick one deliberately. The default awaits and rethrows on the UI `SynchronizationContext`, so a try/catch inside the command sees the fault; setting `FlowExceptionsToTaskScheduler` instead routes it to `TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException`. Prefer the default and catch locally so the failure reaches the user through your dialog or error surface; reach for the flow option only when a deliberate global handler owns it.

## Routed events vs commands

Commands are the default for intent. Routed events are for the low-level interactions commands cannot
express - drag-drop, mouse capture, manipulation. When a routed-event handler is unavoidable in
code-behind, it does one thing: forward to a ViewModel method through a thin private wrapper. No
branching, no domain logic, no state in the handler.

## Clipboard and drag-drop payloads

- Custom types no longer ride onto the clipboard or a drag payload through `BinaryFormatter` - on modern .NET, `Clipboard.SetData`, `SetDataObject`, `DoDragDrop`, and navigation-journal state throw `PlatformNotSupportedException` for any non-intrinsic type (the runtime status and replacement are `dotnet-security`'s A08).
- Put a serializable shape across the boundary instead: a string, an intrinsic type, or your object serialized to JSON or a `byte[]` you re-hydrate yourself. The `System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters` compatibility shim is a migration bridge, not a destination.

## Bindings: explicit and direct

- Always state `Mode` (`OneWay`, `TwoWay`, `OneTime`, `OneWayToSource`). Relying on a property's
  default binding mode is a silent foot-gun when the property's default later changes.
- `UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged` for inputs that validate per keystroke; otherwise leave the
  text-box default of `LostFocus`.
- Reach other elements with `ElementName` or `RelativeSource` (`Self`, `FindAncestor`), not by
  walking `VisualTreeHelper` from code-behind.
- WPF binds with `{Binding}`. Compiled bindings (`x:Bind`) are a UWP/WinUI feature that WPF does not
  have - do not reach for it. Set `x:DataType` only where a tooling analyzer you use consumes it.

## Dependency properties vs ViewModel state

These solve different problems; do not confuse them.

- Register a `DependencyProperty` only on a **control** and only when the value must participate in
  the WPF property system - styling, animation, templating, inheritance, or being set from XAML.
  Give it a default and metadata through `PropertyMetadata`; coerce or reject values with
  `CoerceValueCallback` / `ValidateValueCallback` when an invariant must hold.
- ViewModel state is **never** a `DependencyProperty`. It is an `[ObservableProperty]` raising
  `INotifyPropertyChanged`. A ViewModel that inherits `DependencyObject` has the architecture
  inverted.

## Attached properties

- Use an attached property to bolt behavior or data onto an existing control without subclassing
  (`Grid.Row`, `Validation.HasError`, your own `behaviors:Focus.IsFocused`).
- Each is a `DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached` plus a static `GetX` / `SetX` pair.
- Any side effect (subscribing an event, mutating the visual tree) lives in the property-changed
  callback and is undone symmetrically when the value clears or the element unloads. An attached
  property that subscribes without unsubscribing is a leak.

## Event subscriptions and weak events

- Subscribe and unsubscribe symmetrically - a handler wired in `Loaded` or `OnAttached` is removed in
  `Unloaded` or `OnDetaching`. The leak appears when the event source outlives the subscriber: a
  ViewModel or control handling a static, application-lifetime, or singleton-service event stays rooted
  by that subscription and never collects.
- Break the strong reference in that case - subscribe through `WeakEventManager<TSource, TEventArgs>`
  (or, for ViewModel-to-ViewModel notifications, the toolkit's `WeakReferenceMessenger`) so the handler
  does not keep the subscriber alive - or guarantee the symmetric unsubscribe on teardown. Prefer
  explicit unsubscribe where the lifetimes are clear; reach for the weak-event pattern when the source's
  lifetime is not yours to control.

## Behaviors over code-behind wiring

- Reach for `Microsoft.Xaml.Behaviors.Wpf` for cross-cutting interaction - drag-drop, focus
  management, data-triggered animation, event-to-command glue.
- One behavior per concern; compose several on one element rather than building one omni-behavior.
- This replaces `Loaded` / `Unloaded` subscriptions in code-behind for cross-cutting work. If you
  find yourself adding plumbing in code-behind to react to interaction, a behavior is the home.

## Validation lives on the ViewModel

- Implement `INotifyDataErrorInfo` on the ViewModel. The toolkit's `ObservableValidator` base plus
  data-annotation attributes (`[Required]`, `[Range]`, custom `ValidationAttribute`) gives it for
  free; call `ValidateProperty` / `ValidateAllProperties` to drive it. `IDataErrorInfo` is the
  legacy interface - touch it only to extend a screen already built on it.
- Validation logic is C# on the ViewModel, not `ValidationRule` subclasses declared in XAML - XAML
  rules cannot be unit-tested and entangle view and logic.
- Surface errors with a `Validation.ErrorTemplate` on the control. Never concatenate error strings
  into the bound value itself.
- Validate on set for immediate feedback; revalidate the whole aggregate on submit so cross-field
  rules fire.

## Threading: off the UI thread, marshalled back cleanly

- Long work runs off the UI thread - `await` an I/O `Task` directly, or `Task.Run` for CPU-bound
  work. The UI thread stays free to render.
- Report progress with `IProgress<T>` (`Progress<T>` captures the UI `SynchronizationContext` and
  marshals callbacks for you). Reach for `Dispatcher.Invoke` only when there is genuinely no other
  way - it is the escape hatch, not the tool.
- A ViewModel never touches `Application.Current.Dispatcher`. If it truly needs to marshal, inject a
  dispatcher abstraction so the ViewModel stays testable.
- `ObservableCollection<T>` must be mutated on the UI thread - it raises `CollectionChanged`
  synchronously and the binding engine assumes the UI thread. For high-frequency updates, batch into
  a backing list and replace once, or use a collection type built for cross-thread updates, rather
  than firing thousands of per-item notifications.

## Large lists need virtualization

- `ItemsControl` does **not** virtualize by default. For any sizeable collection use `ListView`,
  `ListBox`, or `DataGrid`, which do.
- Keep `VirtualizingStackPanel.IsVirtualizing="True"`,
  `VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode="Recycling"`, and
  `ScrollViewer.CanContentScroll="True"`. Recycling reuses containers instead of rebuilding them.
- Do not swap in a `Grid`, `WrapPanel`, or `StackPanel` as the `ItemsPanel` for big lists - they
  measure every child and defeat virtualization.
- For tens of thousands of rows, `DataGrid` with `EnableRowVirtualization` and
  `EnableColumnVirtualization` both true.

## ViewModels are unit tests waiting to happen

- Because a ViewModel is a plain CLR object with no `Window` or `Dispatcher` dependency, it tests
  directly - no UI host. The mechanics (framework, fakes, assertions) are the `dotnet-testing`
  skill's; the WPF-specific points are below.
- Assert change notification by subscribing to `PropertyChanged` and checking the property name
  fired.
- Test a command by calling `Execute(...)` and asserting resulting state or a mocked side effect;
  assert `CanExecute(...)` separately from execution.
- Inject every collaborator - `INavigationService`, `IDialogService`, repositories - so the test
  substitutes them. Navigation runs through an `INavigationService`; a ViewModel never does
  `new Window().Show()`.

## Styling and theming

Styling is a View-only concern, the same line as MVVM: the ViewModel exposes state, resources and
styles decide how it paints. Working defaults: keyed styles composed with `BasedOn`, one resource
dictionary per concern merged into `App.xaml`, design tokens (named brushes / thicknesses) instead of
inline literals, and `DynamicResource` for anything theme-dependent so a runtime theme swap actually
repaints; on .NET 9+ prefer the built-in Fluent theme (`ThemeMode`) over a hand-rolled dark palette.
The full discipline - implicit vs keyed styles, `ControlTemplate` vs `DataTemplate` ownership,
theme-dictionary swapping, visual states, Fluent's experimental caveats - lives in
`references/styling-theming.md`.

## Localization

- Every user-facing string comes from a `resx` file (`Strings.en.resx`, `Strings.uk.resx`). No
  literal sentences in XAML or code.
- Bind with `{x:Static loc:Strings.OrderListTitle}` for static text, or a runtime-resolving markup
  extension where the culture can switch live without a restart.
- Build sentences with composite format strings and named-position placeholders, never string
  concatenation - word order is not the same across languages.

## Forbidden in a ViewModel

The types test from the MVVM section catches all of these; the recurring offenders, each owned by a
section above: `MessageBox.Show` (go through `IDialogService`), `Application.Current.Dispatcher`
(inject a dispatcher abstraction - Threading), `FindResource` / `TryFindResource` (resource lookup is
a View concern), business logic in a code-behind event handler (Routed events).
