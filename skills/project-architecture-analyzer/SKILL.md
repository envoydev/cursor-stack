# Project Architecture Analyzer - Capture the Architecture (Deliberate)

You are the architect seat for this run: you build the project's architecture picture by reasoning over cheap digests, and you record it as three committed artifacts - `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` (the neutral structure map, deep-dives under `docs/architecture/references/`), `docs/architecture/ASSESSMENT.md` (the reasoned, tiered evaluation), and `.cursor/rules/baseline-project-architecture.mdc` (the generated always-on awareness rule: a micro-summary plus the trigger to read the map, so every session and subagent knows the docs exist without hand-maintained pointers). The reading is delegated - code-analyzer characterizes one module per dispatch and returns a compact digest - but the judgment is NOT: you aggregate, reconcile, and evaluate in-session, then write the docs yourself. Architecture judgment is the expensive kind, and Cursor cannot pin a skill's model or effort - so run this on a session model you would trust with design work.

This is capture only: it documents and evaluates, it fixes nothing and produces no implementation steps. Working the weaknesses is `project-architecture-quality-loop`, which runs this capture as its ANALYZE step and routes fixes by tier. The per-change fit verdict (extend / refactor first / isolate) is the domain solution-designers', reading the map this skill writes.

Read `references/doc-shapes.md` (the two docs' required shape) and `references/hazards.md` (the stack-keyed hazard catalog you hunt) before AGGREGATE - they are this skill's contract, not suggestions.

## Execution modes
DELEGATED vs INLINE - the shared policy `project-task-flow` owns. Pick once, hold for the run:

- **DELEGATED** (dispatch available) - dispatch code-analyzer per module as below; reasoning and writing stay here.
- **INLINE** (no dispatch: Cursor) - characterize the modules yourself, serena-first and bounded (a module inventory pass, then located reads - never whole-file slurps), and continue at AGGREGATE identically.

## The run

### 1. ORIENT
Read `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/architecture/ASSESSMENT.md` if they exist - a claim to verify, not ground truth - and note which `docs/architecture/references/` files are yours versus user-authored. Read the project's decision log when present (ADRs - `docs/decisions/` under the docs root, or wherever the project keeps them): each accepted ADR is declared intent to reconcile against, and a tradeoff an ADR records deliberately lands in ASSESSMENT.md as an accepted tradeoff, not a weakness. Read the config/manifest files for framework and package facts. Build the module inventory (`get_symbols_overview` / directory listing) - the list of areas to characterize. Scope it if the user did (one bounded context or module subtree on a large codebase); whole project otherwise.

### 2. GATHER - code-analyzer per module, in parallel
Dispatch code-analyzer per module/topic on the inventory - in a single message where the areas are independent. Each returns a compact digest (purpose, public surface, inbound/outbound dependencies, patterns, smells), every claim tied to a located symbol. You are the expensive seat: never read the codebase wholesale yourself - serena (`get_symbols_overview`, `find_symbol` / `find_referencing_symbols`) and `Read` are for light orientation and spot-verification of one edge only.

### 3. AGGREGATE + REASON - in-session
Load the vocabulary you reason with: the domain router (`dotnet`, `frontend`, or `mobile`) for the area's house conventions, `dotnet-architecture` for the architecture-style vocabulary the map names, `csharp-design-patterns` when judging pattern fit in .NET, `dotnet-architecture-tests` when judging whether a .NET boundary is guarded by a fitness test or only by convention, and the convention skill for a file type you must judge in depth. Assemble the digests into the structure - layers, dependency directions, patterns, boundaries - and reconcile against the existing docs: declared vs enforced part company exactly where coupling escapes the static graph (DI registrations, reflection and service location, string-keyed lookups, events and messaging, DTO/entity types reused across a boundary) - treat a name as a hypothesis, an edge as proven only from a usage. Hunt the `references/hazards.md` catalog for the stack in play. Reason out the strengths and weaknesses.

### 4. RE-GATHER on the gaps
Where a part is unclear, uncovered, or one digest conflicts with another, dispatch code-analyzer again on exactly that topic (or spot-verify one edge yourself with serena). **Hard cap: 3 gather rounds.** Still unsettled after 3: write what is established, mark what is uncertain and what would settle it - never guess to fill a section.

### 5. WRITE - the two docs, per references/doc-shapes.md
Load `docs-as-code` before writing - it is the authoring canon for everything doc-shapes mandates: the Mermaid rules for the core-map flowchart and any deep-dive sequence/ER diagram (no hardcoded theme, accessibility lines, the end/hex traps, one-screen sizing), and the format-for-agents discipline (tables and grouped rows over prose, no ASCII art) that keeps the docs cheap for every seat that reads them at orientation. `doc-shapes.md` fixes WHAT each doc contains; `docs-as-code` fixes HOW it is written. Then write `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` (lean core map, deep-dives spilled to `docs/architecture/references/<topic>.md` files linked from a short index) and `docs/architecture/ASSESSMENT.md` (10 strengths + 10 weaknesses, remediation and tier per weakness, summary; strength-check every remediation against the strengths you just recorded - a fix that would erode a listed strength names the tension in its entry and is shaped to preserve it, or the tradeoff is declared and the weakness tiered structural) - clean, scannable Markdown per the `markdown-style` skill. `docs/architecture/` is the default label; the folder is created under the project's configured docs root (per its AGENTS.md). Create `docs/architecture/` and `docs/architecture/references/` only when absent. The `references/` folder is shared with human-authored docs: rewrite only the topic files you author, link the user-authored ones from the index, and never delete a file. Re-run: reconcile in place - correct what drifted, add what is new, drop what is gone. Write ONLY under the configured docs root's `architecture/` folder - never source, never another doc.

### 6. RULE - write .cursor/rules/baseline-project-architecture.mdc
The awareness tier, generated from the fresh capture - a valid PATHLESS rule (frontmatter with a `description:` and NO `paths:`, so it is always-on). Keep it to ~5 lines of body; always-on tokens are paid every session and every subagent, so the fat stays in the docs. The embedded paths below are `docs/architecture/...` by default - the rule is generated code, so when the project's configured docs root differs, bake the actual configured root into these paths at generation time (the rule cannot itself follow the remap convention it exists to reinforce):

# Architecture

<one line: project type + architecture style, from the capture - e.g. 'ASP.NET Core modular monolith, vertical slices'>
<one line: the modules/layers, named - e.g. 'Modules: Orders, Catalog, Identity; shared kernel in BuildingBlocks'>

The full map is `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` (deep-dives under `docs/architecture/references/`,
the reasoned assessment in `docs/architecture/ASSESSMENT.md`) - read the map before planning or
designing any structural change, instead of re-deriving the project.
```

Create `.cursor/rules/` when absent. Regenerate-only: the summary lines come from THIS run's capture (never stale-copied), the trigger paragraph is fixed - never hand-edit the copy, never let it grow module detail, package lists, or assessment content. The rule's name is deliberately NOT in the stack installer's fetch manifest (and never may be - a fetch would overwrite the generated copy); nothing prunes the rules directory, so it survives `stack update`.

### 7. REPORT
Confirm the files written (created vs refreshed, sections touched; the awareness rule created/refreshed). Then lean: gather rounds used and whether the picture settled within the cap; the structure headline; the assessment's shape - strength/weakness counts, tier tally, the top few highest-leverage fixes `project-architecture-quality-loop` should take first; anything unverified and what would settle it. The docs are committed files - they ship with the repo. The map is what the domain solution-designers read to judge where a change fits, what `project-task-flow` reads to pick a cross-domain run, and what the cross-domain seam interface is designed against. No re-paste of the doc bodies - point to the files.

## Don't game it
Record the structure that exists, not the one the names imply - in both docs, every claim traces to code you or a code-analyzer located, and anything unverified is marked unverified, never rounded up to certainty. When a digest looks too clean for the domain, dispatch again or spot-check one edge rather than trust it. In the assessment, an honest weakness beats a flattering omission, and a deliberate tradeoff is labelled a tradeoff, not a defect. Never pad to ten strengths or weaknesses when the codebase is too small to support them - say so instead.
