# Commit checkpoint - the gate before a commit or a publish

The protocol `baseline-git.mdc` points at: what runs before a non-trivial commit, the exemptions, the receipt the `guard-ungated-commit` hook reads at commit time, and the same ceremony for `git push` / `gh pr merge`. It loads when a commit or a publish is the next act, or when the hook's denial names it, instead of riding every message in an always-on rule. The commit-message shape and the branch discipline stay in the rule. The measurements behind these rules live in `references/evidence.md` - an audit appendix, not a run-time load.

## Pre-commit checkpoint

On any non-trivial diff, before committing or presenting: run the formatter, then the house
review `project-verify-code` - read `.cursor/skills/project-verify-code/SKILL.md` and follow it
when it is not already loaded, so the gate holds in autonomous flows too (`/review` is a user-run
parallel sweep, not this gate; `/simplify` applies its quality findings in place) - plus the
security review below when the diff touches auth, crypto, secrets, payment or data-access paths
(`baseline-security.mdc` owns the trigger), plus any diff gates named in the project's `AGENTS.md`
- then satisfy the Definition-of-done gate. Findings caught here land in the same commit; found
later they become fixup noise or shipped defects. Skip for typos / one-line / formatting-only
diffs - and for a diff an equivalent-or-stronger check just cleared: the active quality-loop's own
dispatched re-verify plus final gate, or the cross-task flow's domain-verifier sign-offs plus the
`integration-reviewer` final gate (a self-granted skip on any other reasoning is not this
exemption; the security half has its own narrower carve-out, below). The review half may also run
as a DISPATCHED domain-verifier pass over exactly this diff - the right call when the chat's
carried context is already heavy, since the seat reviews from a clean context - and its sign-off
satisfies the checkpoint the same way. Either way the review is a real run THIS chat: a receipt
claiming 'project-verify-code inline' with no review actually run here is a replay from memory, not
the gate - and on this platform the hook cannot corroborate it (its payload carries no transcript),
so this sentence is the only thing that binds. The formatter half is never skipped, and it must be
FRESH: a formatter run from earlier in the chat does not cover files edited since - re-run it after
the last edit, before the commit. One unformatted commit is a red CI run and a fixup commit. A
quality-loop stage-boundary commit may exceed the one-logical-change size guidance when its stages
share touched files - name the stages in the commit body rather than splitting an unverifiable
diff.

### The security half

`baseline-security.mdc` owns the trigger (crypto / secret / auth / payment / data-access work), the
honesty rules and the `VERIFIED` bar; this is how the review runs. **Do the scoped review yourself,
first:** compute `git diff HEAD` (or the staged diff, or `git diff <base>..HEAD` for a range) and
apply the vulnerability checklist to exactly that - a read-only general-purpose seat where dispatch
exists, inline otherwise, and inline inside a stamped flow where the dispatch guard blocks generic
seats. Feed it the FULL change set - `git add -N .` with the `git reset -q` chained into the SAME
shell call - so untracked files appear in the diff and the intent-to-add entries never outlive it.

`/review` is the UNBOUNDED route, and the bound is not yours to set: it recomputes a whole-branch
diff whatever base it is handed, so an explicit base does not scope it, and a branch level with
origin on a clean tree overflows the same way - 'long-lived branch' is not the trigger either.
Reach for it only when the whole branch really is the review scope and the diff is small.

The checkpoint exemption above skips this half only when the gate that cleared the diff carried a
security pass - the `integration-reviewer` gate does, the quality loop's does not, so a loop diff on
these paths still runs the review before `VERIFIED`.

## The receipt

The checkpoint ends by writing its receipt: `<docs-path>/flow/COMMIT-GATE`, five lines -

```
VERIFIED <what was reviewed, one phrase>
authorized: "<the user's words asking for THIS commit, verbatim>"
head: <the sha the review ran against>
spec: <N files - the set it covered>
live-probe: <what was actually run, or NOT RUN - <reason>>
```

(the quality-loop and cross-task gate exemptions count as VERIFIED - name the loop or gate); or
`WAIVED - "<the user's words, verbatim>"` alone on their explicit waiver - 'commit it' is an
instruction to commit, never a waiver of the review. Each line answers a way the receipt once
passed while recording nothing: the VERIFIED line proves the review ran, `authorized:` proves the
user asked, `head:` proves it reviewed THIS tree, `spec:` proves it covered the whole diff and
`live-probe:` proves it ran the thing. The quoted words must carry a commit verb and must not be an
option label this run wrote: consent given by picking an option is spelled `answered: <the chosen
label>` instead, which is a different claim and reads as one. A review carried from an earlier
cycle says so: `carried: <cycle id>, reviewed <date>`.

On a security-relevant diff the receipt adds a sixth line: `security:` naming each category
checked and its verdict (`security: auth ok, secrets ok, injection ok, data-access n/a`). A
VERIFIED line that claims a security review with no `security:` line, or one that just repeats
'no findings' with no categories named, is the one-line nod `baseline-security.mdc` rejects - the
guard reads it as no review at all. A review carried from an earlier cycle names its categories in
THAT session's receipt, not this one - the `carried:` line above is enough.

Write the receipt at its ABSOLUTE path under the project root, as its OWN tool call, before the
call that runs `git commit` - a relative write follows whatever directory the shell drifted to, and
the gate then reads an absent receipt. The enforcing hook checks the file at commit time, so a
receipt written inside the same compound command is invisible to a stricter gate and unauditable in
the ledger. The shipped hook still ACCEPTS the atomic write+commit shape (blocking it would reject
the receipt discipline itself), so nothing stops you mechanically - which is exactly why the rule is
the binding one. Own-call receipt, then the commit, then clear it.

The `guard-ungated-commit` hook blocks a non-trivial `git commit` without a fresh receipt. The hook
judges 'trivial' mechanically - at most 2 files and 15 changed lines - so a prose-exempt diff above
that bar (a formatting-only sweep) still writes `VERIFIED` naming the exemption; never split a real
change into small commits to slip under it. Clear the file once the commit lands - after the LAST
commit when one receipt covers a reviewed batch - a leftover receipt is the stale-stamp failure the
hook's 2h age cap exists for. A commit in a SIBLING repo gets its own receipt in THAT repo's docs
root, written and cleared the same way.

## Publishing has the same ceremony

`git push` and `gh pr merge` are where the work leaves this machine - other people and CI get it,
and a shared branch cannot be un-pushed quietly - so they carry their own receipt,
`<docs-path>/flow/PUSH-GATE`, in the SAME five-line shape - `VERIFIED <what is being published, one
phrase>`, `authorized: "<the user's words asking for THIS publish, verbatim>"`, `head:`, `spec:
<the commit set going out>` and `live-probe:` - or `WAIVED - "<their words>"`. Only the spec differs
in kind: a publish's spec names what LEAVES the machine, not what is uncommitted here, so it is
required and never counted against the working tree. Say what is going out and to which branch, get
the answer, write the receipt as its own call, publish, clear it. `guard-ungated-commit` enforces
this half too.

When the probe actually ran something and the commit set touches more than one identifiable
project, the receipt adds a sixth line - `scope: <workspace, or the project list the probe ran>`.
One project's narrow test run passed both gates once, the push broke CI right after, and 6.4M
tokens of triage followed; name the whole workspace run (`nx affected`, a full suite) or every
project the diff touches, never just the one that was convenient to test. A single-project or
docs-only push, or a probe that genuinely ran nothing (`NOT RUN - <reason>`), needs no `scope:` line.

**A no-fast-forward publish (`git merge --no-ff`, or a PR merge) creates a NEW head.** Run the
merge first, then write the receipt: `head:` names the resulting merge commit, never the pre-merge
tip - a receipt minted before the merge still reads the branch's old tip, the guard correctly reads
it as reviewing a different tree than what actually pushes, and the retry costs a full edit-and-redo
(measured: ~471k tokens). Probe, write the receipt naming the merge commit, then push.

A push that publishes nothing - a dry run, or a branch already level with its
upstream - is never gated, and a repo whose remote is already gated by branch protection or a
required review turns the half off for good with `CURSOR_PUSH_GATE=0` in the environment.
