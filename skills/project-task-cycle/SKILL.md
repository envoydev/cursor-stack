description: "Use to run a task, feature, or bug through the whole single-chat vertical with a hard user gate between every step: design (project-solution-design writes the plan file) -> plan audit (project-verify-plan) -> user approval + build-mode choice -> build (project-implementer in-session by default, domain implementer agents on explicit ask) -> plan-conformance verify (skippable) -> /review + done-gate. Every stop is a real pause - switch model, add context, or edit the plan before saying go - and the plan file plus a serena cycle note make every step resumable after compaction or in a fresh session. Trigger on run the task cycle, build this with approvals, gated implementation, step-by-step with my sign-off. Not the dispatched multi-agent flow (project-task-flow - trios, cross-domain), not greenfield (project-build-from-scratch), not a one-line edit."

# Task Cycle - the gated single-chat vertical

One task/feature/bug, six steps, and the user holds the gate between every two. The three twin
skills do the work; this skill owns the chain, the stops, the mode choices, and the state that
survives a compaction or a fresh session. It never designs, builds, or reviews anything itself.

## State - two layers, split by durability

- **The plan file** (`<docs-root>/superpowers/plans/<feature>.md`, docs root per the project's
  AGENTS.md) is the durable truth: the tasks, every stamp this cycle adds (`Gated`, `Approved` +
  build mode, `Conformance` verdict or `skipped`, `Completed`), per-task status + evidence. On any
  conflict with memory or the chat, the file wins.
- **The serena cycle note** (`write_memory` named `<feature>__cycle`) is the working cursor:
  current step, chosen modes, resume pointer (plan path + next task), any mid-task scratch worth
  carrying. Update it at EVERY stop and after every task tick; it is never more than one step
  stale when compaction hits. Local and disposable - everything essential is in the plan file.

**On invocation, resume before starting:** `list_memories` -> `read_memory` the feature's cycle
note, and read the plan file's stamps. A cycle mid-flight resumes at its cursor - never restart a
step whose stamp says it already passed.

## The stop contract

At each stop: report one line of result, the artifact path, and what the next step will be - then
END THE TURN and wait. The stop is the user's window to switch model, paste context, or edit the
plan file directly - and the cheap point to run the next step in a fresh session (`/clear`):
resume needs only the plan file + cycle note, so the step starts at a few k of context instead of
re-sending the finished steps' whole conversation with every call - in a long cycle that
carried-forward context is the single biggest token cost. Proceed only on their explicit word;
silence is not a go.

## The steps

1. **DESIGN** - run `project-solution-design`. It writes the plan to the plans folder above; the
   file, not the chat, is the artifact. *Stop.*
2. **GATE** - run `project-verify-plan` over the plan file. It stamps `Gated: passed` or the gaps
   found. Gaps route back to step 1 on the user's word. *Stop.*
3. **APPROVE** - present the gated plan and ask two things in one gate: approval to build, and the
   build mode - **session** (default: the build runs in this chat) or **agents** (each task
   dispatched to its stack's `<stack>-implementer` seat). Stamp `Approved: <date> - mode <session|agents>`
   into the plan file. Nothing builds without this stamp. Agents mode exists only where subagent
   dispatch is available; otherwise session is the only mode - say so rather than pretending.
4. **BUILD** - per the approved mode:
   - *session*: run `project-implementer` - it marks each task `IN_PROGRESS` before code, ticks it
     `DONE` with evidence after its green gate, and keeps the plan's resume note current.
   - *agents*: fan the plan's task cards out to the matching `<stack>-implementer` seats - flat
     fan-out, the main session is the only orchestrator; a red build/test routes per the
     repair-agent rules (`dotnet-repair-agents` / `angular-repair-agents`); tick the same plan file
     per task as reports land.
   *Stop* - and this stop doubles as the conformance decision: run the verify in-session
   (default), dispatch the stack's `<stack>-verifier` for independent eyes, or **skip** straight
   to step 6. The user can inspect the diff themselves here first.
5. **CONFORMANCE** (unless skipped - a skip is stamped `Conformance: skipped by user`, an honest
   record, not a silent gap) - audit the code against the plan file: every task present, nothing
   built outside a task's boundary, each acceptance criterion DEMONSTRATED the way
   `superpowers:verification-before-completion` prescribes (if installed) - by a run in this
   session, quoted, never assumed from reading the diff. Deviations become a punch list routed
   back to step 4. Stamp the verdict. *Stop.*
6. **CLOSE** - `/review` (Bugbot) over the assembled diff, pointed at the plan file so it reviews
   against the plan, not in isolation; apply the findings; then the done-gate (the
   definition-of-done gate in `.cursor/rules/baseline-quality-gates.mdc`, plus
   `superpowers:verification-before-completion` if installed) on the whole feature. Stamp
   `Completed: <date>` with the per-task evidence table. Delete or archive the cycle note.

## Do not

- Never pass a stop without the user's explicit word, and never approve the plan yourself - the
  APPROVE stamp records the user's decision, not yours.
- Never dispatch a seat the user did not choose at a stop - dispatch is explicit-only house-wide.
- Never keep cycle state only in chat: a stamp or tick that is not in the plan file does not
  exist. The serena note is a cursor, never the truth.
- Never re-run a stamped step on resume; pick up at the cursor.
